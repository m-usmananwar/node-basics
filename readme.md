# Node Express API

Welcome to the Node Express API! This application serves as a starting point for building a robust RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Getting Started

To get your local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-usmananwar/node-basics
```
2. **Copy the environment configuration**:
    Copy the contents of .env.example to create your own .env file

```bash 
    cp .env.example .env 
```

3. **Add the required values:**:
    Open the .env file and fill in the necessary values for your environment configuration.

4. **Install the dependencies**:
```bash 
    npm install
```

5. **Start the development server**:
```bash 
    npm run dev
```

6. **Access the API**:
    Your API should now be running on http://localhost:5001. You can test the endpoints using Postman or any other API client.

If you run into any issues, just remember: I'm a newbie too! If something breaks, just do what I do â€” close your eyes, take a deep breath, and hope it magically fixes itself! ðŸ˜‚âœ¨
